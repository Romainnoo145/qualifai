# Milestones: Qualifai

## v1.0 — MVP Sales Engine (Completed)

**Shipped:** 2026-02-20
**Phases:** 1–5 (scaffolded as single MVP)

### What shipped:

- Company enrichment + contact discovery via Apollo
- Research pipeline (fetch + parse + evidence extraction)
- Evidence quality gate
- Workflow Loss Map + Call Prep generation (PDF)
- Outreach sequence drafting with CTA enforcement
- Reply webhook handling + auto-triage
- Cal.com booking integration
- Signal tracking
- Public wizard (personalized landing per prospect)
- Admin command center
- Multi-touch task queue (call/LinkedIn/WhatsApp)
- Apollo plan-limit guardrails
- Campaign management

### Key learnings:

- Apollo free tier blocks people-search — need bulk import alternative
- Research fetch-only misses JS-rendered content and Google Reviews
- Evidence gate too permissive — outreach goes out without strong proof
- Email-only outreach too narrow — multi-touch needed
- Proof matching via Obsidian works but not scalable — needs in-app management
