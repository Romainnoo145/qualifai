<objective>
Final terminology sweep (TERM-02) across the entire app, replacing all remaining internal technical terms with user-facing equivalents.

Purpose: After the new section layout is built (plans 01-04), ensure every label, heading, and field name the admin sees uses plain language. This is the final pass before Phase 13 is complete.

Output: All user-visible strings use plain language. No "workflowTag", "proofMatch", "Bottleneck", "Automation Opportunity", or other internal jargon remains visible to the admin.

  <action>
    Read each of the 5 files and audit every user-visible string. Replace any internal terms:

    **Known targets (from codebase analysis):**

    1. `workflowTag` values displayed to users — these are raw enum-like strings from the AI pipeline. Map them to plain labels:
       - "lead_qualification" -> "Lead Quality"
       - "workflow_bottleneck" -> "Process Bottleneck"
       - "tech_stack_gap" -> "Technology Gap"
       - "hiring_signal" -> "Hiring Activity"
       - "customer_sentiment" -> "Customer Feedback"
       - "automation_potential" -> "Automation Opportunity"
       - For any unmapped tag: sentence-case and remove underscores

    2. "Bottleneck(s)" in section headings -> "Challenge(s)" (should already be fixed in 13-02, verify)

    3. "Automation Opportunity/Opportunities" -> "Improvement Area(s)" (should already be fixed in 13-02, verify)

    4. "proofMatch" or "proof matching" in any visible text -> "service matching"

    5. "confidenceScore" displayed as raw numbers -> ensure displayed as percentage or qualitative indicator

    6. "EvidenceSourceType" raw enum values shown to users -> ensure plain-language mapping is used consistently

    7. "Hypothesis/Hypotheses" in visible text -> "Finding(s)" (the analysis section should use this, verify)

    8. "ResearchRun" in any visible text -> "Research" (no "run" suffix)

    9. "Deep Crawl" in visible text -> "Deep Research" or "Extended Research"

    10. Any remaining references to "Sprint", "Nodes", "Loss Map", "Call Prep" in visible text (should be caught by TERM-01, but verify)

    Follow the TERM-01 pattern: change ONLY user-visible string literals. Do NOT rename variables, props, function names, or tRPC procedure names. Internal identifiers stay as-is.

    For each change, add a comment if the mapping is non-obvious (e.g., `// TERM-02: workflowTag displayed as plain label`).

    After changes, grep the 5 files for any remaining jargon patterns:
    ```
    grep -n "workflowTag\|Bottleneck\|proofMatch\|confidenceScore\|Deep ?Crawl\|Sprint\|Nodes\|Loss ?Map\|Call ?Prep" <file>
    ```
    (Only flag strings that appear in user-visible JSX text, not in variable names or prop references.)

  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no type errors.
    Grep for jargon patterns in JSX text nodes confirms no user-visible jargon remains.
  </verify>
  <done>
    All new section components and the prospect detail page use plain language. No internal technical terms visible to admin.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Sweep remaining admin pages for TERM-02 jargon</name>
  <files>
    app/admin/use-cases/page.tsx
    app/admin/campaigns/page.tsx
    app/admin/contacts/[id]/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Scan these three files for remaining internal terms:

    1. **use-cases/page.tsx** — line 147: "evidence-backed offerings for proof matching" -> "evidence-backed offerings for service matching" or just "Service catalog — evidence-backed offerings that can be matched to prospect needs"

    2. **campaigns/page.tsx** — line 212: `{campaign._count.workflowLossMaps} Briefs` -> This is acceptable ("Briefs" is the plain-language term from TERM-01), but verify no other jargon exists

    3. **contacts/[id]/page.tsx** — Scan for any "loss map", "call prep", or other jargon in user-visible strings. The `latestLossMap` variable name stays (internal), but any visible text referencing it should say "Report" not "Loss Map".

    Also do a broad grep across the entire `app/admin/` directory for remaining user-visible jargon:
    ```
    grep -rn "Loss Map\|Call Prep\|Sprint Intelligence\|Nodes\|proof matching\|Deep Crawl" app/admin/ --include="*.tsx"
    ```

    Fix any remaining instances following the TERM-01 pattern (visible strings only).

    Run `npm run check` to verify everything passes.

  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run check` — passes type-check + lint + format.
    Broad grep for jargon across app/admin/ returns no user-visible instances.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Full TERM-02 sweep complete. All user-visible text across the entire admin UI uses plain language. No internal technical terms remain in headings, labels, or field names.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npm run check` passes
2. grep for banned terms (Loss Map, Call Prep, Sprint Intelligence, Nodes, proof matching, Deep Crawl) across app/admin/ and components/ returns no user-visible string matches
3. workflowTag values are displayed with plain-language labels
4. "Bottleneck" and "Automation Opportunity" replaced with "Challenge" and "Improvement"
5. All section headings use plain language
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Zero internal technical terms in any user-visible text in the prospect detail
- Zero internal technical terms in use-cases, campaigns, and contacts pages
- workflowTag display uses plain-language label mapping
- TERM-02 requirement fully satisfied
- TypeScript compiles without errors
  </success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/13-prospect-story-flow/13-05-SUMMARY.md`
