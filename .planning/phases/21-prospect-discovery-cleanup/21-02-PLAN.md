<objective>
Remove dead admin pages that are no longer part of any workflow.

Purpose: The pages /admin/hypotheses, /admin/research, and /admin/briefs are no longer linked from any nav or workflow. They were superseded by the prospect detail page sections (analysis, evidence, outreach). Removing them prevents confusion from stale UIs that could still be reached via direct URL.

Output: All three pages return HTTP 404 when accessed directly.

  <name>Task 1: Replace dead admin pages with notFound() stubs</name>
  <files>
    app/admin/hypotheses/page.tsx
    app/admin/research/page.tsx
    app/admin/briefs/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Replace the contents of all three page files with the same server component stub that calls `notFound()` immediately. This produces an HTTP 404 via Next.js App Router.

    Each file should contain exactly:
    ```typescript
    import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

    export default function RemovedPage() {
      notFound();
    }
    ```

    Important notes:
    - Remove the `'use client'` directive — `notFound()` must run in a server component (Pitfall 4 from research).
    - Remove all existing imports, state, hooks, and JSX — the entire file content is replaced.
    - Do NOT delete the directories — keeping the file with `notFound()` preserves git history and is explicit about intent.
    - These pages are NOT linked from the nav (confirmed: admin layout nav has Dashboard, Companies, Campaigns, Draft Queue, Use Cases, Signals — none link to hypotheses/research/briefs).
    - The tRPC routers (hypotheses, research, briefs) remain intact because other components (prospect detail analysis section, command center, workflow engine) still use them. Only the standalone admin pages are removed.

  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no type errors.
    Verify each file contains `notFound()` call: `grep -l "notFound" app/admin/hypotheses/page.tsx app/admin/research/page.tsx app/admin/briefs/page.tsx`
    The dev server should return 404 for /admin/hypotheses, /admin/research, /admin/briefs.
  </verify>
  <done>
    All three dead admin pages (/admin/hypotheses, /admin/research, /admin/briefs) return HTTP 404. No other pages or tRPC routers are affected.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Type-check: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
2. Each of the three files contains only the notFound() server component stub
3. Direct navigation to /admin/hypotheses, /admin/research, /admin/briefs all show Next.js 404 page
4. No broken imports or references elsewhere (the tRPC routers are untouched)
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- /admin/hypotheses returns 404
- /admin/research returns 404
- /admin/briefs returns 404
- No type errors introduced
- No other admin pages affected
  </success_criteria>
