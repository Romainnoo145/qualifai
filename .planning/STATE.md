# State: Qualifai

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-02-20 — Milestone v1.1 started

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-20)

**Core value:** Every outreach message is backed by real evidence, matched to a service Klarifai actually delivers.
**Current focus:** v1.1 Evidence-Backed Multi-Touch Outreach

## Accumulated Context

- Apollo people-search endpoints blocked on current plan (free tier) — confirmed 2026-02-20
- Multi-touch task queue (call/LinkedIn/WhatsApp) already scaffolded in v1.0
- Research pipeline exists but uses fetch-only (no browser rendering)
- Proof matching via Obsidian exports exists but needs in-app management
- Evidence quality gate exists but is too permissive for outreach blocking
